# Gold Price Predictor

## Overview

This project is a web application that provides a fictional prediction for the best time to buy gold. It will display a mock current price, a prediction (Buy, Hold, Sell), a historical data chart, and a section for expert opinions.

## Project Outline

### Style and Design

*   **Layout:** A sophisticated, professional dashboard layout with a sidebar for navigation and a main content area with multiple data widgets.
*   **Color Scheme:** A refined financial theme using shades of gold, dark grays, and white, with a secondary accent color for data visualization.
*   **Typography:** A clean, modern sans-serif font family with a clear hierarchy for headings, data points, and body text.
*   **Visuals:** The historical data will be represented by a line chart instead of a bar chart to give it a more professional look.

### Features

*   **Current Price Display:** Shows a mock, dynamically updated gold price.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A simple algorithm to generate a "Buy," "Hold," or "Sell" recommendation based on the mock price.
*   **Historical Chart:** A visual representation of fictional historical gold prices.
*   **Expert Opinions:** A section with static, pre-written expert analysis.

## Plan

1.  **Update `index.html`:** Create the new structure for the dashboard.
2.  **Update `style.css`:** Apply a new, professional stylesheet with a financial theme.
3.  **Update `main.js`:** Implement the logic for the mock price updates, prediction, and chart generation.
